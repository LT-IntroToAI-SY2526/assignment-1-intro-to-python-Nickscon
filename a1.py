Example:
Problem: Write a function called 'is_even' that takes an integer and returns 
True if the number is even, False if it's odd.

Example inputs/outputs:
- is_even(4) should return True
- is_even(7) should return False

# Problem 6: FizzBuzz

# Topic: Loops, conditionals
# Task:
# Print numbers from 1 to 50. But for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. For multiples of 5, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

# Problem 7: Find the Largest Number

# Topic: Lists, loops, conditionals
# Task:
# Ask the user to enter 5 numbers. Store them in a list. Then find and print the largest number.
