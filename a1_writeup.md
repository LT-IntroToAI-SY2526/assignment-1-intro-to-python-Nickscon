# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?
    My initial experience with python wasn't that bad, I've previously had experience in media computation and that let me back into the groove of things easier. It operates slightly differently compared to the coding languages I've used like java or C++. With variable definition or loops or even print statements vary depending on the languages. But overall it was not bad.
2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.
    I used AI effectively by asking it specifically when I was having an issue for it to check my code and explain what it sees my code doing and what is going wrong and how I would fix the code, but not provide me the code. Only in psuedocode or through explanation.
    Example: Take a look at (insert code) using this, it's currently going through x error. What does my code do well currently? And what can I do to fix it. And explain in psuedocode. 
    In multiple lines of prompt but most of the time I did do these. 
    And every time it refreshed my memory of how to efficiently use loops or functions and remove unecessary code from my functions.
3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?
    The concepts that were most challenging were removing strings from lists and returning lists, or messing with arrays/lists. And AI helped me understand it by suggesting and teaching me how the pop command works and how to reduce the clutter in my code. Also another concept that was challenging to grasp was when to use break and when not to use break becuase for while loops when the condition is met the loop stops thus removing the need for break, but if another condition is met before then, that is when you would incorporate a break function. And AI helped me grasp that concept really well throughout the practice problems and py problems. 
4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?
    Asking for pseudocode or just asking for like nudges in the right direction by AI rather than just asking for the answer it self. Because in both ways you'll get an explanation regardless if you prompt it like
    "Whats wrong with my code?" and it would give you the answer and explanation but once you have an answer it doesn't really help.
    But prompting it
    "What could I fix about my code? Please explain in pseudocode." And this time it gives you the answer in psuedocode so you still have to grasp the concepts it explains in psuedocode to get the answer like learning popping strings from an array from earlier. While giving an explanation of what went right and what went wrong. Which really help because it leads to less confusion because it focuses the single area of code you need to fix.
